Learning R
==========

R is a very powerful and flexible statistics package and programming language.

This repository contains a number of 'howto' files aimed to providing an introduction to R and some os its possibilities. 

You can install R and RStudio with the following links:
- R: https://cran.rstudio.com/
- Rstudio: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download


Some other great sites for learning R are:
- [OpenIntro statistics](http://openintro.org/stat/labs.php) with a number of good statistics 'labs' in R
- [Quick-R](http://www.statmethods.net) with explanations and sample code for a wide array of applications
- [Advanced R Programming](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/) for (much) more information on what is really going on.

Dealing with textual data
----

For textual data, we have also developed two R packages to [communicate with the AmCAT text analysis framework](http://github.com/amcat/amcat-r) and to [deal with corpus analysis and topic models](http://github/com/kasperwelbers/corpustools). We also wrote two relevant howto's:

- [Corpus Analysis: Term document Matrices, frequency analysis, and topic modeling](https://rawgit.com/vanatteveldt/learningr/master/corpus.html) ([source](https://github.com/vanatteveldt/learningr/blob/master/corpus.Rmd)))
- [Claues Analysis: Using grammatical analysis for semantic network analysis](https://rawgit.com/vanatteveldt/learningr/master/clauses.html) ([source](https://github.com/vanatteveldt/learningr/blob/master/clauses.Rmd)))

Below are also some handouts that do not depend on AmCAT, based on a Dutch data set:

  - [Corpus Analysis: Term Document Matrices](https://rawgit.com/vanatteveldt/learningr/master/text_1_corpus.html) ([source](https://github.com/vanatteveldt/learningr/blob/master/text_1_corpus.Rmd))
  - [LDA topic modeling](https://rawgit.com/vanatteveldt/learningr/master/text_2_lda.html) ([source](https://github.com/vanatteveldt/learningr/blob/master/text_2_lda.Rmd))
  - [Lemmatization](https://rawgit.com/vanatteveldt/learningr/master/text_3_lemma.html) ([source](https://github.com/vanatteveldt/learningr/blob/master/text_3_lemma.Rmd))
  - [Machine Learning with RTextTools](https://rawgit.com/vanatteveldt/learningr/master/text_4_texttools.html) ([source](https://github.com/vanatteveldt/learningr/blob/master/text_4_texttools.Rmd))


Network Analysis

- [Communication networks](https://github.com/kasperwelbers/network-tools/blob/master/howto/howto_explicit_ties_in_communication_networks.md)([source](https://github.com/kasperwelbers/network-tools/blob/master/howto/howto_explicit_ties_in_communication_networks.Rmd))

(The last part of the 'semantic network analysis' demo above also has  a simplistic network analysis at the end)
